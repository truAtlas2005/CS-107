### About Me
I'm a passionate biology student at Loyola University Maryland, working toward a career at the intersection of conservation and science education. With a strong foundation in ecological and evolutionary biology, data analysis, and hands-on lab techniques like PCR and cell culture, I thrive on turning complex scientific ideas into understandable and impactful nuggets of knowledge.

My background includes independent research on the effects of orchid mycorrhizal fungi on crop growth, recognition at the Minnesota State Science and Engineering Fair, and leadership experience as an Eagle Scout and fencing team captain. I'm committed to continuous learning, problem-solving, and bringing energy and creativity to every project I take on — whether it’s in the lab, the classroom, or out in the field.

When I’m not studying or working, you’ll find me diving into tabletop games, discussing big ideas at Philosophy Club, or planning my next outdoor adventure.

#### Calculating Correlations Between Statistics in MATLAB using Baltimore Children's Health Statistics

- Summary:
This project focused on applying statistical analysis tools in MATLAB to real-world health data. By leveraging MATLAB’s built-in functions, I conducted ANOVA tests to identify significant differences between groups, calculated correlation coefficients to explore relationships between variables, and summarized findings through descriptive statistics. Additionally, I managed and cleaned the dataset by manipulating matrices and tables, culminating in the export of organized results to an Excel file for easy sharing and further analysis.
